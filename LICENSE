    1. Use
      You may use our tool for the sole purpose of experimentation. 
      You may not use this program to cause any harm and/or damage to 
      any servers even if it is stated that the purpose is to cause harm
      and/or damage. We do not track any information so the responsibility
      is on your hand. We also do not care if you use our tool to cause
      harm and/or damage since that's what we are aiming for.
      
      a) We are responsible for any harm and/or damage that you cause and 
         you are not responsible for it. If someone claims that you are,
         contact HackySoft for help or show this license to the said person.
      b) If you think you are being tracked / have proof of spywares in
         the client, please contact HackySoft and give proof of the spyware
         as that is a big concern for us.
    
    2. Reproduction
      You may use the client to make your own tool, but only if you add
      credits or fork. If you are caught to have our client without
	  credits, you will be held accountable for every damage caused by
	  the client and will be sued by the o7 External Affairs Group.
    
    3. Distribution
      You are allowed to distribute the client only if there are proper credits.
      If you are caught to have our client without credits, you will be
      held accountable for every damage caused by the client and will be
      sued by the HackySoft Group.
